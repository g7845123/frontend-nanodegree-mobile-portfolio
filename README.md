This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I should optimize a [target website](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio), including:

* Optimize the Critical Rendering Path and achieve a PageSpeed score above 90 (for both mobile and desktop)
* Find out major issuess in JavaScript code that lead to low performance. And optimize the code to ensure a consistent frame rate at 60fps

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.txt".
